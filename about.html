      <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jordan Crawford and I have been making jewelry since I was a wee tot! I love trying to create unique designs and using found materials. I am originally from Vermont, lived and went to school in Boston for four years, and I just moved to Colorado! Feel free to also follow me on facebook at Jewelry by Jordan! I update it frequently and it has a lot of my past works on it!</p>
